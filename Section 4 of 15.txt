Stealth Game 3
AI Guards

We will put some AI guards around the objective item, these guards will be difficulty 
for the player to pick the objective. 
AI will be able to see the players and listen to voices. 
To give the player a chance to win, we will code a distraction mechanics to use against 
the guards. 
You make them move away by bouncing the weapons projectile against the wall triggering the
noise.

Use simple AI to create an obstacle for the player to overcome. 
Code a distraction mechanic. 

======================================================================

24. Create a AI guard class. 

Derived from Parent class - Character. because the character class have meshes in it which will be use-
ful. Have mesh, Componenet and built in movement logic.  

Create new blueprint class. - derived from FPSAIGuard class. 

Set up Pawn Sensing component in a code- to hear and see the player and noise we will
be creating with the projectile. 

Since first time using AI - go into GameBuild.cs and add AI module. 

====================================================================

25. Setup Sight sense. 

Change all hearing, line of sight, radius settings in BP_Guard in viewport.
two events - On see pawn, on hear noise. 

//If the pawn sees another player or the AI, the game is over immediately.  

ame\private\fpsaiguard.cpp(31): error C4706: assignment within conditional expression

==============================================================================

26. Setup the hearing sense. 

to make pawn hear noises - Add a noise emmiter component. 

Whenever player is seen by the guard, it will no longer use the noise. 
Whenever player gets out of the line of sight of the guard, the green players will start to appear. 


====================================================================================

27. Add noise making to projectile. 

When player shoots, green sphere will appear, given that player shoots in the hearing range of dwarf. 

==========================================================================================

28. Setup Guard Distraction. 

Adding distraction to the guard. 
Add some instructions to the guard. 
We rotate the guard to the location where we heard the voice from. So we have to rotate the whole
actor when we hear the noise. 
For that use the function - lookAtRotation. 
We are passing the vector and converting the vector into rotator. 
	FRotationMatrix::MakeFromX(X).Rotator(); 
(X) is actually a direction vector. Location is unit vector. (just a location, not a direction yet.) So we have to convert that into direction. 
we do that by generating vector map by subtracting location from origin(Actor location)


Turn this guard into its original rotation after certain amount of seconds have passed. 
- remember the original rotation 
- set timer to return to remembered rotation. 

==========================================================================================

29. Add Game-Over trigger when spotted.
	And also move the camera away. 

If the player gets the objective item to the extraction box by distracting the dwarf, "Mission Complete!" message will be displayed on the screen. 
Otherwise, if the player comes in line of sight of dwarf "Game Over!" will be displayed on the screen. 

This is done by creating binding on the text "Mission Complete" and desiging the blueprint accordingly. 

=============================================================================================

30. Add 3D UI state above guard. 
Whenever dwarf is suspicious of the player, we want to add question mark, whenever he sees the player, we want to exclamation mark.
