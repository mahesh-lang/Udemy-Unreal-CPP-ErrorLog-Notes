Spawn a particle system. - UGamePlayStatics

Access static function - SpawnEmitterAtLocation(three parameters, GetWorld function and particle system(a variable we have to create), GetActorLocation function)

GetWorld is part of the actor and projectile is derived from an actor. 

We are using UGamePlayStatics class we have to tell the compiler where to find this class. So, add - #include "kismet/"

also in .h file - specify that UParticleSystem is a class
